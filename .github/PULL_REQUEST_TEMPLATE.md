- [ ] Change to an existing skill
- [ ] Shared script / MCP tool (`scripts/`, `mcp-server/`)

- [ ] `name` matches the folder; `description` says **what + when** and is ≤ 1024 chars.
- [ ] Passes local validation — `python3 scripts/quick_validate.py`, `scripts/listing_gate.py`, `scripts/check_shared_client.py` (CI runs the same).

- [ ] Any script that mutates remote state supports `--dry-run` and defaults to paused/inactive.
