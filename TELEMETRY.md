# Telemetry

The retained compatibility runtime contains **anonymous, opt-out** usage telemetry. It is measured
in one format across the MCP server and direct library use at the shared client dispatch every call
funnels through. This page documents the existing behavior exactly; Zoro does not add a separate
analytics layer.

## What we collect

For each tool invocation, one event with **only** these fields:

| Field | Example | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `event` | `oss_tool_used` | the event name — a fixed constant, identical on every event |
| `tool_name` | `image_generate` | which tool was used (the whole point) |
| `ok` | `true` | did it succeed |
| `duration_ms` | `1840` | performance |
| `error_class` | `TimeoutError` | exception *type* only — never the message |
| `error_code` | `provider_error` | normalized failure reason (fixed vocabulary) — never raw error text |
| `surface` | `mcp` \| `direct` | which surface the call came from |
| `route` | `byok` \| `proxy` | your own key vs the managed proxy |
| `provider` | `fal` \| `gemini` \| … | which vendor served it (BYOK only) |
| `model_id` | `nano-banana` | which model (a slug, not content) |
| `supercmo_version`, `os`, `arch`, `python_version` | `0.1.6`, `darwin`, `arm64`, `3.11` | compatibility |
| `is_ci`, `agent` | `false`, `claude` | segment CI/agent-driven runs |
| `install_id` | `a1b2…` (random UUID4) | approximate unique installs + retention |
| `session_id`, `event_id`, `sample_rate` | — | ordering / dedupe |

## What we NEVER collect

- Your **prompts** or any **tool arguments** (image/video prompts are user content).
- **Generated** images, videos, audio, or their URLs.
- **File paths, file names, or file contents.**
- **API keys** of any kind.
- Your **hostname, username, MAC address, or machine fingerprint.**
- Your **IP address** — it is used only transiently for rate-limiting at ingest and is
  never stored.
- Any **account identity.** The random install id is not linked to an account.

The client sends **only the allowlist above** — the field list is an allowlist in code
(`scripts/supercmo_skills/telemetry.py`), so nothing else can leak by accident.

## The install id

A random UUID4 generated once and stored at `~/.local/state/supercmo/install-id`
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\supercmo` on Windows). It is **not** derived from any machine attribute.
Delete that file to rotate it. In CI it is not persisted; all CI runs share the single id
`"CI"`.

## How to turn it off

Any one of these disables telemetry completely (env vars win over everything):

- `SUPERCMO_TELEMETRY=false`
- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (the [Do Not Track](https://consoledonottrack.com/) standard)
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` (inherited from Claude Code)

To **see** what would be sent without sending it: `SUPERCMO_TELEMETRY=log` prints each
payload to stderr.

## Where it goes & how long we keep it

Events are POSTed to the retained runtime endpoint,
`https://api.getsupercmo.ai/api/v1/telemetry/events`. The endpoint forwards anonymised events to
PostHog. Disable telemetry with one of the controls above, or block that endpoint at the network
layer.

**Retention:** we keep events only for PostHog's default data-retention window — currently 1 year on
PostHog's free plan, up to 7 years on paid plans — after which PostHog deletes them. We do not extend
it. Since everything here is anonymous (no account, no IP, no machine identity), there is nothing to
tie a retained event back to you.

## How it's delivered (why it can't slow you down)

Each event is appended to a small local spool file; a background thread uploads batches
best-effort with a short timeout and gives up silently on failure. A telemetry problem can
never block, delay, or break a tool call — it fails closed and stays out of your way.
